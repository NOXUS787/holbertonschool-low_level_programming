This project is about function pointers in C. Its goal is to understand what function pointers are, what they actually hold in memory, and where they point to in the virtual memory space, as well as how to use them in practice (for example, to call different functions through the same interface or to build callback-style behavior). All files must be written in C, follow Betty style (including proper documentation comments for every function), be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89, contain no global variables, and have no more than five functions per file. Only the standard library functions malloc, free, and exit are allowed, _putchar may be used, and a header file named function_pointers.h with include guards must contain all function prototypes (including _putchar). A README.md at the root of the project is mandatory, and example main.c files are only for local testing and should not be pushed, since the checker will use its own main files.
