# 0x0A. malloc, free

## Project Description

This project focuses on dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free`. You will learn how to allocate memory at runtime, manipulate it, and free it to avoid memory leaks.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the difference between automatic (stack) and dynamic (heap) memory allocation.
- Understand and use `malloc` and `free`.
- Know when and why to use `malloc`.
- Use Valgrind to detect memory leaks.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using:
  ```bash
  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
