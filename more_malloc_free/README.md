This project focuses on writing the function malloc_checked, which allocates memory using malloc and, if the allocation fails, terminates the program with exit status 98. The function follows the prototype void *malloc_checked(unsigned int b);, returns a pointer to the allocated memory when successful, and uses only allowed functions (malloc, free, and exit). All code must follow Betty style, including proper documentation. The task is tested by allocating memory for different data types, and the program must exit immediately with status 98 if any allocation fails. Compile using gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-malloc_checked.c -o a.
