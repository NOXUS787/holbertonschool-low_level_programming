# C - Recursion

## Description
This project introduces the concept of **recursion** in C programming.  
Recursion occurs when a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem until reaching a base case.  
You will learn when and how to use recursion effectively, and when to avoid it.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is recursion  
- How to implement recursion in C  
- In what situations recursion should be used  
- In what situations recursion should **not** be used
